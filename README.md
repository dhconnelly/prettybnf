prettybnf
=========

a JavaScript library for working with BNF grammars

About
-----

`prettybnf` provides a parser for Backus-Naur Form grammars and a stringifier
for pretty-printing BNF abstract syntax trees.  It uses the traditional BNF
syntax as opposed to `yacc` syntax.

Getting Started
---------------

Get the source code from [GitHub](https://github.com/dhconnelly/prettybnf) or
just [download](http://dhconnelly.github.com/prettybnf/prettybnf.js) the latest
version.  You can also find it as an [npm module](https://npm.im/prettybnf).

You can use `prettybnf` both in Node.js apps and in modern browsers.  Only
browsers that implement ECMAScript 5.1 with strict mode are supported.  This
includes Chrome 13+, Firefox 4+, Safari 5.1+, IE 10+, and Opera 12+
([source](http://kangax.github.com/es5-compat-table)).

To use the library in your project:

- in a Node.js app using `npm`: do `npm install prettybnf` and add
  `var prettybnf = require('prettybnf')` to your scripts.
- in a Node.js app, manually: put `prettybnf.js` somewhere and add
  `var prettybnf = require('./path/to/prettybnf.js')` to your scripts.
- in a browser app: put `prettybnf.js` somewhere and add the usual
  `<script src="path/to/prettybnf.js"></script>` tag to your HTML.  This will
  create a global object named `prettybnf`.

Usage
-----

There are four top-level exports on the `prettybnf` object:

```js
{
    version: '0.1.1', // defines your version of the library
    parse: function (grammar) {}, // String -> AST node
    stringify: function (ast) {}, // AST node -> String
    Parser: function (grammar) {}, // parser internals for testing
}
```

The parser constructs an AST, composed of AST nodes, from a grammar.  Each node
is an object with a `type` property  and other relevant properties.  The five
node types are as follows:

```js
{ type: 'grammar',
  productions: an Array of productions }

{ type: 'production',
  lhs: a nonterminal,
  rhs: an Array of expressions }

{ type: 'expression',
  terms: an Array of terminals and nonterminals }

{ type: 'nonterminal',
  text: the nonterminal String }

{ type: 'terminal',
  text: the terminal String }
```

`prettybnf.parse` returns a `grammar` node.

The language recongized by the `prettybnf` parser is defined by the following
self-describing grammar:

```ebnf
<empty> ::= "";

<space> ::= " " | "\n" | "\t";
<letter> ::= "a" | "b" | "c" | "d" | "e" | "f" | "g" | "h" | "i" | "j"
           | "k" | "l" | "m" | "n" | "o" | "p" | "q" | "r" | "s" | "t"
           | "u" | "v" | "w" | "x" | "y" | "z"
           | "A" | "B" | "C" | "D" | "E" | "F" | "G" | "H" | "I" | "J"
           | "K" | "L" | "M" | "N" | "O" | "P" | "Q" | "R" | "S" | "T"
           | "U" | "V" | "W" | "X" | "Y" | "Z";
<digit> ::= "0" | "1" | "2" | "3" | "4"
          | "5" | "6" | "7" | "8" | "9";
<delim> ::= "-" | "_" | "|" | ":" | "=" | ";" | " ";
<escaped> ::= "\\\"" | "\\n" | "\\t" | "\\\\";
<char> ::= <letter> | <digit> | <delim> | <escaped>;
<terminal_char> ::= <char> | "<" | ">";

<ws> ::= <space> <ws> | <empty>;
<text> ::= <char> <text> | <empty>;
<terminal_text> ::= <terminal_char> <terminal_text> | <empty>;
<term> ::= <terminal> | <nonterminal>;
<terminal> ::= "\"" <terminal_text> "\"";
<nonterminal> ::= "<" <text> ">";
<expression> ::= <term> <ws> <expression> | <term> <ws>;
<expressions> ::= <expression> "|" <ws> <expressions> | <expression>;
<production> ::= <nonterminal> <ws> "::=" <ws> <expressions> ";";
<grammar> ::= <production> <ws> <grammar> | <production> <ws>;
```

Example
-------

Consider the following grammar, which you might have saved in the file `g.bnf`:

```ebnf
<list>  ::=  "<" <items> ">"               ;
<items> ::=  <items> " " <item> | <item>   ;
<item>  ::=  "foo" | "bar" | "baz"         ;
```

To read this grammar from the file, parse it, and print the AST, you might do
the following:

```js
// Node.js specific:
var prettybnf = require('prettybnf'), fs = require('fs');
var g = fs.readFileSync('g.bnf', 'utf8');

// The grammar is stored in the string g
var ast = prettybnf.parse(g);
console.log(ast);
```

This will print out the AST for the above grammar, which looks like

```js
{ type: 'grammar',
  productions:
   [ { type: 'production',
       lhs: { type: 'nonterminal', text: 'list' },
       rhs:
        [ { type: 'expression',
            terms:
             [ { type: 'terminal', text: '<' },
               { type: 'nonterminal', text: 'items' },
               { type: 'terminal', text: '>' } ] } ] },
     { type: 'production',
       lhs: { type: 'nonterminal', text: 'items' },
       rhs:
        [ { type: 'expression',
            terms:
             [ { type: 'nonterminal', text: 'items' },
               { type: 'terminal', text: ' ' },
               { type: 'nonterminal', text: 'item' } ] },
          { type: 'expression',
            terms: [ { type: 'nonterminal', text: 'item' } ] } ] },
     { type: 'production',
       lhs: { type: 'nonterminal', text: 'item' },
       rhs:
        [ { type: 'expression',
            terms: [ { type: 'terminal', text: 'foo' } ] },
          { type: 'expression',
            terms: [ { type: 'terminal', text: 'bar' } ] },
          { type: 'expression',
            terms: [ { type: 'terminal', text: 'baz' } ] } ] } ] }
```

You could add another expression to the `<item>` production:

```js
var item = ast.productions[2];
item.rhs.push({
    type: 'expression',
    terms: [{ type: 'terminal', text: 'hello' },
            { type: 'nonterminal', text: 'list' }]
});
```

Now print out the modified grammar:

```js
var h = prettybnf.stringify(ast);
console.log(h);
```

The resulting grammar looks like

```ebnf
<list>  ::=  "<" <items> ">";
<items> ::=  <items> " " <item> | <item>;
<item>  ::=  "foo" | "bar" | "baz" | "hello" <list>;
```
